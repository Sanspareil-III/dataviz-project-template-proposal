# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is structured data in XML format. We have test data for power system equipment.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

It would be nice to have a dashboard that can plot the equipment location on a map and then when you open the equipment it shows you all pertinent records. 
From there, it would be nice to compare the test data in that record to all the records for that make/model of equipment.
How does the new test data compare across geographic areas?
How does the new test data compare to equipment of the same model?

Would be nice to add more statistical graphics as well

## Open Questions

I'm worried about pulling in XML data for the first time, I haven't done that with JS. I feel 
(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones


(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
