# Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project involved visualizing structured XML data related to power system equipment tests. It aimed to analyze trends in equipment distribution and performance across different manufacturers, breaker types, and geographic or climate conditions.

## Data
The project utilized XML data concerning power system equipment testing. This data helped in conducting comparative and performance analysis.

## Key Questions Addressed
### Distribution Trends
- Analyzed the distribution of equipment by different manufacturers using pie charts.
- Explored common breaker types to identify trends in equipment usage.

### Performance Trends
- Compared new test data across different geographic areas and climate zones, highlighting regional variances.
- Analyzed new test data against similar equipment characteristics to find performance standards.

### Comparative Analysis
- Investigated how pole resistance measurements vary with humidity using scatter plots.
- Examined changes in resistance based on different fuse sizes, also visualized through scatter plots.

## Milestones Achieved
- Displayed multiple XML sheets to allow cross-sheet comparisons.
- Developed a dashboard integrating multiple views for better data interaction.
- Set dynamic upper/lower limits for parameter visualizations to enhance user experience.
- Created comparative plots for all equipment with specific characteristics, enabling detailed analysis.

## Future Directions
Further work can enhance interactivity, integrate more granular data filters, and explore machine learning techniques for predictive analytics.

## Closing Thoughts
This project not only demonstrated capabilities in data visualization but also in handling complex XML data and developing interactive tools for effective data presentation. 
Keeping the visualization interactive and starting with very small implementations provded challenging but a rewarding experience.
