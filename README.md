# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is structured data in XML format. We have test data for power system equipment.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

It would be nice to have a dashboard that can plot the equipment location on a map and then when you open the equipment it shows you all pertinent records. 
From there, it would be nice to compare the test data in that record to all the records for that make/model of equipment.
How does the new test data compare across geographic areas?
How does the new test data compare to equipment of the same model?
