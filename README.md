# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is structured data in XML format. We have test data for power system equipment.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

How does the new test data compare across geographic areas or climate zones?
How does the new test data compare to equipment of the similar characteristics?

## Sketches

## Milestones

### Week 11 ###
* Accept multiple XML sheets
### Week 12 ###
* Plot data for equipment that has been tested throughout the years with insights, highlighting by category.
### Week 13 ###
* Compare data from sister assets or trending data from the same asset on one plot.
### Week 14 ###
* Plot the equipment on a map with a tooltip that shows the equipment parameters and records
### Week 15 ###
