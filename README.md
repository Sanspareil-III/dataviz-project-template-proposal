# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is structured data in XML format. We have test data for power system equipment.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

  ### Distribution Trends
  * What is the distribution by manufacturer?
  * What are the most common breaker types?
  
  ### Performance Trends
  
  * How does the new test data compare across geographic areas or climate zones?
  * How does the new test data compare to equipment of the similar characteristics?

  ### Comparitive Analysis
  * How does the pole resistance measurement change based on humidity?
  * How does the fuse resistance change based on fuse size?

## Milestones

### Week 11 ###
* ~~Display multiple XML sheet~~
### Week 12 ###
* ~~Plot data for equipment that has been tested throughout the years with insights, highlighting by category.~~
### Week 13 ###
* ~~Create a dashboard to hold multiple views~~
### Week 14 ###
* Set upper/lower limits to X/Y or Brushing, Filter for Manufacturer
* Compare data from sister assets or trending data from the same asset on one plot.
### Week 15 ###
* Plot the equipment on a map with a tooltip that shows the equipment parameters and records
### Week 16 ###
* Compare all equipment with certain characteristics (Ampere Rating, Manufacturer, Model, etc.) on a bell curve or similar
