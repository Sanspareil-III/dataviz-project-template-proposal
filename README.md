# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is structured data in XML format. We have test data for power system equipment.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

* Create a dashboard to hold multiple views
* Plot the equipment on a map with a tooltip that shows the equipment parameters and records
* Plot trending data for equipment that has been tested throughout the years as a line chart
* Compare two sister assets on the same trend plot
* Compare all equipment with certain characteristics (Ampere Rating, Manufacturer, Model, etc.) on a bell curve or similar

How does the new test data compare across geographic areas?
How does the new test data compare to equipment of the similar characteristics?

## Open Questions

I'm worried about pulling in XML data for the first time, I haven't done that with JS. I feel
